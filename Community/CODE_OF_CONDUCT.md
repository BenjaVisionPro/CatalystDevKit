# Catalyst Code of Conduct

Catalyst is a collaboration built on respect and curiosity.

- Treat others with kindness and patience.
- Assume good intent, even when disagreeing.
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- If conflict arises, talk it out or ask a maintainer for mediation.
- Keep discussions on topic and inclusive.
- When someone stumbles, help them back up.

Breaches are handled privately first, publicly only if needed.
Our goal is restoration, not punishment.
