# Catalyst Governance

Catalyst is an open project maintained by its community, guided by trust.

## 🪞 Maintainers
The Maintainers are responsible for:
- Merging pull requests and reviewing code.
- Approving releases.
- Managing community tone and direction.

Current Maintainers:
- Jupiter Jones (Lead Architect)
- Barry (Community Assistant)

## ⚙️ Decision Process
- **Small changes**: Maintainers decide via pull request review.
- **Major changes**: Community proposal → discussion → consensus or vote.
- **Votes**: Each active contributor (anyone with merged PRs in the past 6 months) may vote.
- **Ties**: Broken by Maintainers through consensus.

## 🪙 Funding & Tokens
- Community funds and Catalyst Sparks are transparent and publicly tracked.
- Token use and bounty allocations are visible and auditable.
- All revenue and expenses are published quarterly.

## 🐕 Good Standing
Community members are valued for generosity and respect.
Loss of standing (e.g. ignoring the pact) can be restored by renewed contribution or support.

No bans, only paths back to participation.
