# The Catalyst Community Pact

Catalyst exists because people choose to share.

By joining, contributing, or using Catalyst, you agree to uphold the spirit of the pack:

1. **Be generous** — with your time, code, and encouragement.
2. **Be fair** — give credit, respect effort, and pay it forward.
3. **Be kind** — we grow faster when everyone feels safe to learn.
4. **Be transparent** — if you profit from Catalyst, support it.
5. **Be curious** — help ideas evolve; question, but don’t belittle.
6. **Be accountable** — when something breaks, fix it together.

This is not enforced by law — it’s sustained by community esteem.  
If you act in bad faith, you lose standing. If you act in good faith, you gain it.

We don’t ban. We **invite people back to good standing** by showing support, generosity, or contribution.
