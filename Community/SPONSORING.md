# Supporting Catalyst

Catalyst is completely open. Every contribution helps keep it alive.

## 🎟️ Membership Tiers

| Tier | Cost | What you get |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Join the Pack** | $100 (one-time) | Your name listed as a Supporter, Discord access, and community voting rights. |
| **Support the Pack** | $200 (one-time) | Everything above + receive 10 **Catalyst Sparks** tokens. |

### 💡 Catalyst Sparks

- Sparks are **non-transferable for money** — they are **gifts** of gratitude.
- You can **gift Sparks** to others to:
  - Redeem **SaaS time or cloud credits**.
  - Boost someone’s visibility in the community.
  - Fund feature bounties or documentation requests.
- You can’t use Sparks you haven’t been gifted.  
  *The pack gives power — you don’t keep it.*

Each Spark used publicly (e.g., gifting another dev) earns both the giver and receiver recognition points on the leaderboard.

### 🧭 Bounties

Want a feature? Post a bounty in the community tracker.  
- Fund it with Sparks or direct contributions.  
- Developers can claim and complete bounties to earn tokens or cash.  
- Maintainers verify and merge successful work.

Catalyst survives on mutual generosity — not enforcement.  
If you benefit, contribute. If you can’t code, help fund.  
If you can’t fund, gift your Sparks or your time.
