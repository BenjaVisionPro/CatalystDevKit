# 🌍 Catalyst

**Catalyst** is an open, community-driven framework for building, connecting, and evolving interactive worlds.

It’s completely open-source under the [MIT License](LICENSE), built to last as long as people find it useful — and designed so the people who use it can help sustain it.

## 💡 Vision

Catalyst exists to make complex systems *simpler, smarter, and shared*.

We believe open collaboration can produce technology that’s elegant, ethical, and enduring — if we make generosity the default.

That’s why Catalyst is:
- **Open forever** – no paywalls, no locked modules, no “enterprise” edition.  
- **Community-first** – every contribution counts: code, design, docs, ideas, funds.  
- **Reciprocal by nature** – we give back to those who give, through recognition, tokens, and shared ownership of success.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

Catalyst is made up of interconnected layers that power creative and technical ecosystems:
- 🧠 **Catalyst Foundation** – core frameworks and APIs.  
- 🌐 **Catalyst Connect** – networking and real-time communication.  
- 🌱 **Catalyst Ecosystem** – simulation, biomes, and procedural life systems.  
- 🎮 **That Game** – a planetary-scale simulation built using Catalyst.  

Each plugin and module lives in this repo or linked submodules — all open, all hackable.

## 🪙 Catalyst Sparks

Catalyst runs on **Sparks** — symbolic, non-monetary tokens of appreciation.

- Sparks **cannot be bought** — only earned or gifted.  
- You must **receive** a Spark to redeem it for anything (support time, SaaS credits, bounty votes, etc).  
- You can **gift** Sparks to others for great work, generosity, or creative magic.  
- Both givers and receivers gain community recognition.  

Sparks are our social glue: a way to say “thank you” that actually means something.

## 🌈 Values

> **Freedom through generosity.  
> Sustainability through reciprocity.  
> Innovation through kindness.**

Catalyst isn’t policed by lawyers — it’s held together by shared respect.  
If you ignore the Pact, you lose standing; if you contribute, you rise again.

This project lives or dies by its community — and we plan to live *a very long time.*
