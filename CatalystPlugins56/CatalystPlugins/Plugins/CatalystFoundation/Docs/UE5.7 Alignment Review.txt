Catalyst Foundation 5.7 — Peer Review Summary

(UE5.7-Aligned Architecture Evaluation)

⸻

✅ Core Architecture
	•	Combines UPrimaryDataAsset + root UStruct for reflection-safe models.
	•	Runtime model ownership via UGameInstanceSubsystem, ensuring persistent, modular data flow.
	•	Editor integration through native Unreal APIs (UFactory, FAssetTypeActions, FAssetEditorToolkit) guarantees maintainability and Blueprint friendliness.
	•	Commandlet layer with atomic writes, schema tagging, and CI-ready output ensures deterministic asset generation.

⸻

⚙ Runtime Lifecycle
	•	Asynchronous soft-reference loading (via FStreamableManager) eliminates stalls and supports modular feature loading.
	•	Multicast delegates expose lifecycle events (OnModelReady, OnError, etc.) for clean async coordination.
	•	Runtime duplication separates immutable seed assets from mutable live data.
	•	Thread safety enforced with FReadScopeLock / FWriteScopeLock.

⸻

🧠 Editor Workflow
	•	Clear separation between runtime/editor modules prevents dependency bleed.
	•	Registered factories & asset type actions integrate cleanly under “Add New → Catalyst → ”.
	•	DetailsView-based editors with live validation offer immediate, safe feedback.

⸻

🧾 Commandlet Pipeline
	•	Atomic I/O (temp + rename) ensures file integrity.
	•	Embedded { SchemaVersion, PluginVersion, EngineVersion } metadata supports migration.
	•	Flags: -Overwrite, -DryRun, -Verbose — structured log/JSON reports for CI.
	•	Full error summaries exported per batch for pipeline consumption.

⸻

🌐 JSON Handling
	•	FJsonObjectConverter ensures thread-safe import/export.
	•	Malformed data never crashes — falls back to defaults, logs clearly.
	•	All parse/apply failures emit both UE_LOG and diagnostic broadcast.

⸻

🔍 Logging & Diagnostics
	•	Per-plugin log categories (LogCatalystFoundation, etc.) aid filtering.
	•	Scoped, timestamped logs compatible with Unreal Insights.
	•	Planned Diagnostic Manager aggregates async and commandlet events.

⸻

🔄 Live Update & Hot Reload
	•	Services detect content reloads → broadcast OnModelReloaded.
	•	Editors auto-invalidate Details Views.
	•	Runtime validity checks guard against stale data.

⸻

🧪 CI & Automation
	•	Fail-fast validation halts bad JSON early.
	•	bin/build-models.sh automates regeneration.
	•	“Catalyst Weather” example plugin provides reference.

⸻

🚀 Recommended 5.8 Targets
	•	Chunked async import for massive datasets.
	•	Prominent in-editor version mismatch warnings.
	•	Strict pairing of asset type registrations on reload.
	•	Expanded diagnostic/profiling hooks for multi-plugin insight.

⸻

Verdict:
Catalyst Foundation 5.7 is a production-grade Unreal Framework — fully aligned with UE5.7’s data-driven paradigms, CI-integrated, and developer-centric. Future refinements focus on scalability, transparency, and enhanced UX for large-team ecosystems.
